âš¡ Software engineering is my main major in Kabul University, faculty of computer science, and now I'm a junior software engineer there. In addition to my main major, I love web design and development. My web development journey begun about two years ago(late 2019). Right now I am using laravel php's framework for backend development, but I use vue.js and tailwind css or bootstrap for front-end development. I have done so many small and medium projects with Laravel, Php, Vue.js, Tailwind css, Html, css, Bootstrap and vanilla JavaScript.  I have worked with MySQL and PostgreSQL DBMSes.

ðŸŒ± I intend to learn Nuxt.js and mobile app development with Laravel.
